Based on your calendar and recent activity, here are today's priorities:\n\n1. **API v2 Migration** — Marcus needs your input on the breaking changes list\n2. **Onboarding flow** — The A/B test results from last week are in\n3. **Quarterly report** — Finance is waiting for your commentary on the PDF\n\nWant to dive into any of these first?"},

      {"message_type": "assistant", "content": "The API v2 migration is about 60% complete. Marcus finished the endpoint inventory yesterday. Current blockers:\n\n- **Authentication endpoints** — Need to decide between OAuth2 PKCE vs API key rotation\n- **Rate limiting** — The new tier structure hasn't been finalized\n- **Client SDK** — Sarah needs 3 more days for the iOS update\n\nThe biggest risk is the 2-week parallel run window. If we slip on the SDK update, we might need to extend it."},
      {"message_type": "user", "content": "Let's keep the parallel window at 2 weeks. Can you summarize what we need from Sarah by Friday?"},
      {"message_type": "assistant", "content": "Here's what Sarah needs to deliver by Friday:\n\n1. **iOS SDK v2 client** — Updated auth flow with PKCE support\n2. **Migration helper** — Automatic endpoint remapping for v1 → v2 calls\n3. **Test coverage** — Integration tests for the top 10 most-used endpoints\n\nI'll note this as a follow-up item. Should I also check in with Marcus about the rate limiting decision?"}

Here's a summary of your onboarding ideas:\n\n- **Progressive disclosure** — Don't ask for all permissions upfront; request them contextually\n- **Guided tour** — 4-step interactive walkthrough hitting the core value props\n- **Value-first approach** — Show users one \"aha moment\" before asking them to set up their profile\n\nUsers who complete onboarding retain 3x better according to your notes. Want me to draft a proposal document?"},

      {"message_type": "assistant", "content": "The recommendation engine latency is a good target for caching. Current P95 latency is 340ms, mostly from the embedding similarity search. Options:\n\n1. **Redis** — In-memory cache for hot embeddings. Expected 40% latency reduction.\n2. **Application-level LRU** — Simpler but limited to single instance.\n3. **CDN-level caching** — For public API responses only.\n\nI'd recommend Redis for this use case. It handles the vector similarity cache well and scales horizontally."},
      {"message_type": "user", "content": "Let's go with Redis. What do we need to benchmark before production?"},
      {"message_type": "assistant", "content": "Before scaling Redis to production, you should benchmark:\n\n1. **Memory footprint** — Each cached embedding is ~6KB. At 100K unique queries/day, that's ~600MB\n2. **Cache hit ratio** — Target >70% for the cost to be justified\n3. **Eviction strategy** — LRU vs TTL-based (recommend TTL of 1 hour for freshness)\n4. **Failover behavior** — What happens when Redis is down? Fallback to direct DB query.\n\nI can help you set up the benchmark script if you'd like."},
      {"message_type": "user", "content": "Good analysis. Let's also consider the memory budget on our current infra."},
      {"message_type": "assistant", "content": "Current infrastructure budget analysis:\n\n- **Available memory**: 8GB on the cache tier (r6g.large)\n- **Current usage**: 2.1GB (session store + rate limits)\n- **Available for Redis cache**: ~5.5GB after headroom\n- **Estimated need**: 600MB base + 200MB for spikes = ~800MB\n\nWe're well within budget. The r6g.large instance can handle this without an upgrade. If query volume doubles, we'd still only be at ~1.6GB. This is a safe bet."},

Capturing:\n\n**What went well:**\n- Deployment frequency 3x improvement (2/week → 6/week) — Sarah\n- CI pipeline speed improvement — Marcus\n- Frontend test coverage 45% → 68% — Priya\n\nThese are significant wins. What about pain points?"},

I'd suggest:\n1. Jordan + Priya: Quarantine and fix flaky tests (deadline: mid-sprint)\n2. Team-wide: 24-hour PR review SLA starting next sprint\n3. Marcus: Docker Compose staging setup to match production\n\nDoes this look right?"},

Based on your recent discussions, the main breaking changes are:\n\n1. **Auth endpoint** — `/auth/token` → `/v2/auth/token` with PKCE\n2. **Pagination** — Offset-based → cursor-based\n3. **Error format** — Flat errors → RFC 7807 Problem Details\n4. **Rate limits** — Per-key → per-tier with burst allowance\n\nWant to add any others?"},

The migration guide should include:\n- Before/after payload examples\n- Adapter library for backward compatibility\n- 30-day deprecation window for v1 webhooks\n\nI've saved this as a note moment tagged with #api, #migration, #v2.

The critical path is the SDK update — if Sarah's iOS work slips, everything shifts right. I'd recommend a mid-sprint check-in on SDK progress."}

Our voice notes → moments → searchable memory is unique. Double down.\n2. **Cross-app context** — Integrate with Slack, Linear, and GitHub to pull context that Notion's walled garden can't access.\n3. **Proactive insights** — Instead of reactive AI (\"rewrite this\"), deliver proactive observations (\"I noticed a pattern in your meetings...\").\n\nThese play to our strengths while exploiting Notion's weaknesses. Should I share this with the product channel?"},

      {"message_type": "user", "content": "It's actually worse than we thought. Users who hit the permissions step on mobile have a 47% drop-off vs 28% on desktop. The mobile permissions dialog is overwhelming — camera, mic, and location all at once."},
      {"message_type": "assistant", "content": "That's a significant mobile-specific issue. The 47% vs 28% gap suggests the native permission dialogs are the problem, not your UI.\n\n**Hypothesis**: Mobile OS permission prompts are more disruptive than web browser prompts.\n\n**Recommendation**: Progressive permission requests — only ask for each permission when the user first needs that feature:\n- Camera → when they first try to capture an image\n- Microphone → when they first try voice notes\n- Location → when they first use location tagging\n\nThis pattern typically reduces permission-step drop-off by 40-60% based on industry data."},

Captured your voice note:\n\n**Mobile Push Strategy**\n- Current opt-in: 45%\n- Test A: Permission prompt at end of onboarding\n- Test B: Permission prompt after first \"value moment\" (e.g., first saved moment)\n- Hypothesis: Test B → 60%+ opt-in rate\n\nThis aligns with the progressive permissions approach you discussed with Jordan. The \"ask after value\" pattern is well-supported by behavioral research. Should I tag this with the onboarding work?"},

Key things to check in the review:\n\n1. **Token storage** — Refresh tokens should be hashed in DB, never stored as plaintext\n2. **Rotation policy** — Refresh token rotation on each use (prevents replay attacks)\n3. **Clock skew** — JWT `exp` should have a 30-second grace period\n4. **Revocation** — How are compromised tokens invalidated? Blocklist or short-lived access tokens?\n5. **Test coverage** — Auth edge cases (expired tokens, malformed JWTs, concurrent refresh)\n\nDoes the PR address token revocation?"},

      {"message_type": "assistant", "content": "Good analysis. Let me structure this as an ADR:\n\n**ADR-008: Event Sourcing for Payments Domain**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Full audit trail → Compliance requirement for SOC 2\n- Temporal queries → \"What was the state at time T?\" for debugging\n- Replay capability → Deterministic testing of payment flows\n\n**Cons:**\n- Operational complexity → Need event store infra (EventStoreDB or custom on Postgres)\n- Eventual consistency → Payments need strong consistency for balances\n- Learning curve → Team has no event sourcing experience\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- Use CQRS only for the payments aggregate, not system-wide\n- Synchronous projections for balance queries (strong consistency)\n- Start with Postgres-backed event store (familiar infra)\n\nShould I capture this decision?"},
      {"message_type": "user", "content": "Yes. My recommendation is to proceed with event sourcing but only for the payments domain. Start with Postgres-backed events."},
      {"message_type": "assistant", "content": "Captured as a note moment:\n\n**Decision**: Adopt event sourcing for payments domain only\n**Implementation**: Postgres-backed event store (no new infra)\n**Scope**: Payment aggregates — NOT system-wide CQRS\n\nTagged with #architecture, #payments, and #event-sourcing. This pairs well with the Redis caching decision — together they form the technical strategy for Q2.\n\nNext steps: Marcus should review this before the implementation spike."}
