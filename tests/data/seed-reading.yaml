# Prerequisites — the resources must exist first:
#   p8 upsert resources tests/data/seed-reading-resources.yaml
#
# Then upsert the reading moment for the default test user (Sage Whitfield):
#   p8 upsert moments tests/data/seed-reading.yaml
#
# Or for any other user (overrides user_id, recomputes deterministic IDs):
#   p8 upsert moments tests/data/seed-reading.yaml --user-id <USER_ID>
