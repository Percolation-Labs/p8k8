# What is Percolate?

Percolate is a memory for a world in which humans an AI collaborate to create and get stuff done! At its foundation their is acloud native agentic tech stack build on Postgres and layered on top of this is a memory layer that handles ingestion and retrieval of specially designed content and content indexes. 

Percolate is modelled on real human memory - different types of "indexes" for episodic and procedural and ontological memory are used to model concepts and events. The system constantly updates its memory to model a users interaction with the system or an organisation's knowledge. This knowledge can be like a Wiki that describes everything about the business including processes which can be thought of as agents that can join your team and get stuff done. As such you can think of Percolate as modelling your memory or your organisations memory. 


A database layer called "rem db" (REM - Resources Entities Moments) provides a simple query interface for LLMs to query data in the most convenient way for the natural language query. This can include graph lookups and traversals, semantic search or plain old SQL. 


Percolate can be deployed to your own Cloud - its a batteries included agnetic workflow framework and semantic database for building production grade agents that co-create with you and just get stuff done.
