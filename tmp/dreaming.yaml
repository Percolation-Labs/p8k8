  summary: We see an intriguing parallel between asynchronous microservice communication via NATS JetStream and event-driven
    triggers in ML training pipelines. Both rely on message queues and events to decouple components and enable scalable,
    incremental processing. This suggests an opportunity to unify tooling or monitoring strategies across these domains to
    streamline operations and observability.

  summary: 'Our discussions reveal a recurring pattern of boundary enforcement across different domains: API gateways use
    JWT and rate limiting to enforce access control boundaries, while ML pipelines apply schema validation to ensure data
    quality. This pattern highlights a shared architectural principle of validating inputs at system edges to prevent downstream
    failures and maintain reliability.'

  summary: We discovered a strong architectural synergy between our microservices communication patterns and ML data pipelines.
    The API gateway pattern leveraging Kong with JWT validation parallels the schema validation in our ML data preprocessing,
    both enforcing boundaries to ensure system integrity. Additionally, the asynchronous messaging via NATS JetStream mirrors
    event-driven triggers common in ML pipelines for incremental training, suggesting a unified approach to managing both
    service calls and data workflows.
